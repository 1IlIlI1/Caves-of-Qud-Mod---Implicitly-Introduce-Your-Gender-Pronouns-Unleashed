# Caves-of-Qud-Mod---Implicitly-Introduce-Your-Gender-Pronouns-Unleashed
Implicitly Introduce Your Gender Pronouns Unleashed.  Basically hackjob of sorts.  

Combined these mods below because they are essentially one mod in my playthroughs.

Tested and Working on Caves of Qud Version 204.59

# Please Allow Me To Introduce Myself

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2480450931

With this mod, any creature who you can converse with who does not already have a proper name can be asked their name, which will change their appearance to show their name from then on.



# Gender and Pronoun Sets

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1735379738

Adds gender and pronoun sets, of sorts suitable for the Qud setting, to character generation and various NPCs and NPC interactions.

This is essentially a sneak preview of functionality that will probably be part of the shipped game in a similar if not identical form.



# Implicit Pronoun Exchange

https://github.com/HeladoDeBrownie/Caves-of-Qud-Minimods/tree/Main/Implicit%20Pronoun%20Exchange

Removes the textual notice of exchanging pronouns when using the Gender and Pronoun Sets mod.



# Qud: Genders Unleashed

A mod that works in conjunction with the [Gender and Pronoun Sets](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1735379738) mod to allow your delver to wreathe themselves in the gender identity and pronouns they feel most comfortable in.

Specifically, this mod allows you to pick from all personal genders and pronouns defined in game (including pseudo-plural ones), with a number of additions.

Additionally, the "choose pronoun" prompt in game has been modified to use the modern UI. This will facilitate picking from the extended list this mod provides.

*`=name=` pronoun sets:* Starting with version 1.1, `=name=` in a pronoun set will be dynamically replaced with the player character's name (`=name's=` with the possessive version). To demonstrate this, a pronoun set consisting completely of `=name=` and `=name's=` has been added.
